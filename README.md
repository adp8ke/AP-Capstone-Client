#Welcome to Release Me Human!

## Description:

This app is designed to help users find off-leash/no-leash specific dog parks in the Hampton Roads Area. As a user, you can search by the city name and get a list of parks associated with that city. You can then click on the park name, and then see reviews made by other users. If registered and logged in, you can add parks to your favorites and even leave your own review consisting of a comment and a rating. This app is not meant to be re-used by other developers as it requires controlled data in terms of the park list.

## Stack

This is a fullstack app designed using React, CSS, Node, Express, and PostgreSQL.
